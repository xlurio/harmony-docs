Example - Sorting a color palette
=================================

####################
Create a colors file
####################

 - The first step is to write the colors in a file called ``colors.txt`` (for the file specification, see :ref:`file_specification`)::

    (49, 6, 210) Dark Blue
    #0f8fb3 Light Blue
    (201, 118, 6) Orange


###############
Sort the colors
###############

- Now we will run the following command::

    $ harmony sort color.txt

- After that, a file named `colors_hillbert_sorted.txt` should be generated in the same directory with the following content::

    (201, 118, 6) Orange
    #0f8fb3 Light Blue
    (49, 6, 210) Dark Blue
